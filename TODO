Remaining Gtk+ 3 porting work:
- Figure out why dragging the map around doesn't work.
- Re-add possibility to click on a marker in the map and
  get the search hit in the sidebar selected.
  (Was dropped in commit 
   "Removed no longer existing champlain properties/signals"
   because of api changes.)

Plugins:
- placemarks:
  - ability to specify placemark color in the manager dialog
