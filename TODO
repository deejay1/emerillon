Remaining Gtk+ 3 porting work:
- Re-add possibility to click on a marker in the map and
  get the search hit in the sidebar selected.
  (Was dropped in commit 
   "Removed no longer existing champlain properties/signals"
   because of api changes.)
- Figure out how to re-add lat/lon command line options
  for startup position without breaking clutter.
  (Was dropped in commit
  "Drop lat/lon options and init gtk_clutter first!"
  because of problems with dragging the map around)

Plugins:
- placemarks:
  - ability to specify placemark color in the manager dialog
